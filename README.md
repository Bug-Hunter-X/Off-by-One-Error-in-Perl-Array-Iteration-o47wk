This repository contains a simple Perl program that demonstrates a common off-by-one error when iterating through an array.  The `bug.pl` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.pl` provides the corrected version.  This example highlights the importance of careful array indexing in Perl to avoid runtime errors.
